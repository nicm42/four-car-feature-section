# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

Challenge from Frontend Mentor, who provided the design and images.

I did this to practise CSS Grid, since the four cards are in a very different configuration between mobile and desktop versions. Having done it, I then found that Internet Explorer treats grid gap quite differently and had to re-do where everything was on the grid.
